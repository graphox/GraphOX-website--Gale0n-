This is my version of the upcoming GraphOX website, with framework.

I use the GiiX generator (still need to generate most pages, getting there) for my controllers and models. GiiX is an extension of Gii.

I use the Yii framework ( http://yiiframework.com/ ) for this website. The MySQL schema is now available in the *MAIN (root) DIRECTORY* (GraphOX.sql)
